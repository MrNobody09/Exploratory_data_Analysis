# Marketing Analysis Dataset Documentation

This documentation provides a detailed overview of the analysis performed on the "Marketing Analysis" dataset. The dataset contains information about customers, including their age, salary, marital status, job and education level, contact details, and responses to marketing campaigns. The analysis aims to uncover insights and relationships within the data for future marketing predictions.

### 1. Introduction

The "Marketing Analysis" dataset was provided for analysis. It includes the following columns:

- Customer ID
- Age
- Salary
- Balance
- Marital Status
- Job and Education Level
- Whether the customer was previously targeted
- Types of loans (personal or housing)
- Contact type
- Month of contact
- Duration of the call
- Outcome of the previous contact
- Customer's response after the call

### 2. Data Preprocessing

- **Data Loading**: The dataset was loaded into a Pandas DataFrame.
- **Data Cleaning**: Rows with missing values in the 'age' and 'response' columns were removed. Customer IDs were dropped as they were not needed for analysis.
- **Feature Engineering**: The 'job' and 'education' columns were extracted from the 'jobedu' column, and 'jobedu' was subsequently dropped.

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

#### 3.1. Missing Values
- Missing values in the 'month' column were filled with the mode value (most frequent month).

#### 3.2. Data Distribution
- The distribution of customers across different job categories and education levels was analyzed.
- The percentage of customers in each job category and education level was visualized.

#### 3.3. Data Visualization
- Scatter plots were created to explore relationships between 'salary' and 'balance' and 'age' and 'balance.'
- Pair plots were generated to visualize the relationships between 'salary,' 'balance,' and 'age.'
- A correlation matrix was computed and visualized using a heatmap.

#### 3.4. Response Analysis
- The mean and median salaries for customers who responded with 'yes' and 'no' were calculated and visualized using box plots.
- A 'response_rate' column was created to represent customer responses numerically (1 for 'yes,' 0 for 'no').

#### 3.5. Marital Status and Loan Analysis
- Bar plots were created to show the average 'response_rate' for different marital statuses and loan statuses.

#### 3.6. Education vs. Marital Status Analysis
- A pivot table was generated to analyze the relationship between education, marital status, and 'response_rate.'
- A heatmap was created to visualize this relationship.

### 4. Key Insights

Based on the analysis, the following key insights were gathered:

- Salary and balance are positively correlated.
- No significant correlation was found between age and either salary or balance.
- Customers who responded with 'yes' tend to have a higher mean and median salary compared to those who responded with 'no.'
- Marital status appears to have an impact on the 'response_rate,' with single customers having a higher response rate.
- Education and marital status together affect the 'response_rate,' as shown in the heatmap.

### 5. Conclusion

This analysis provides valuable insights into customer data that can inform future marketing strategies. It highlights the importance of factors such as salary, marital status, education, and loan status in predicting customer responses to marketing campaigns.

### 6. Future Predictions

For future predictions, machine learning models can be built using this dataset. Features like salary, marital status, education, and loan status can be used to predict customer responses (yes/no) to marketing campaigns. Additionally, further feature engineering and data preprocessing may enhance the predictive power of these models.
